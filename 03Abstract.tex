\abstract{%
  We introduce a \emph{reachable type analysis}, a new path-sensitive, sound, interprocedual analysis that uses heap-shape information to overapproximate all possible types reachable from objects. The resulting reachable type set can then be used to further refine heap-shape information generated by other tools. A preliminary evaluation of the analysis by measuring the accuracy of dynamic dispatch resolution occurring in the analysis itself shows substantially improved results.
