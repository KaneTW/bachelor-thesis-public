We have developed a path-sensitive, sound, interprocedual reachable type analysis that can be used to improve existing tools and analyses. 
By utilising path-sensitive information from an existing heap-shape analysis in a data flow analysis we determine an overapproximation of all possible types reachable from a given reference along with paths describing where said types actually occur. We devised a data representation allowing for modular analysis with high data reuse based on an existing formulation of heap paths. Additionally we have proven the analysis sound and gave starting points on how to  combine the reachable type analysis with other analyses. Evaluation based on dynamic dispatch resolution in the analysis itself shows a significant improvement in accuracy: up to $29\%$ reduction in parametric type set size. Finally we provide key points on further improving the analysis, such as rectifying the inexactness in dynamic dispatch caused by the design choice to only run the analysis once on each method or integrating it with the used heap-shape analysis to allow for a tradeoff of performance with exactness.
